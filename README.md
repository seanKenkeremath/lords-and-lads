# lords-ands-lads
Rulebook for the Lords &amp; Lads stump variant

# Rules
## You will need:
* 1 stump
* 1 hammer
* 1 nail for each player. These nails must all be the same type
* 3 nails to be placed in the center of the stump. These nails do not necessarily have to be the same
* Any number of players

## Setting up
### Nails
Begin by hammering 1 nail for each player into the stump. All nails should be placed along the same ring of the stump. 
All nails should be hammered to an equal, agreed upon depth. Hammer the 3 center nails into the center of the stump. 
All players must stand around the stump by their nail.


### Establishing turn order
If this is the first game of Lords &amp; Lads, players choose and agree upon a way to decide who goes first.
If this is not the first game of Lords &amp; Lads, the player who won the last game gets the first turn.
Turns will proceed clockwise from that player.


## The Game
### Overview
All players begin the game as Lads. 
A Lad ascends to the rank of Lord when his or her starting nail has been hammered completely into the stump.
As a Lad you are only able to strike your starting nail. As a Lord you are allowed to strike the 3 center nails.
The game ends when the 3 center nails have been hammered completely into the stump. The winner is the person who dealt the final strike to the last nail.


### Taking a turn
A turn consists of 3 phases:
* Flip phase
* Strike phase
* Drink phase


#### Flip
During the flip phase, a player throws the hammer into the air so that it flips vertical (head over handle). 
The player then attempts to catch them hammer after it flips at least once in the air.


The number of vertical flips is the number of strikes the player may make in the Strike phase.


The player may not adjust their grip on the hammer. 
The way that player catches the hammer is how they must perform their strikes.


Upon catching the hammer, the player must immediately move to the Strike phase without hesitation.


If a player fails to catch the hammer, they must drink and immediately end their turn, passing the hammer to the next play in turn order.


#### Strike
Upon catching the hammer, the player must immediately perform a strike.
The player may not hesitate or aim, though they are allowed to bring them hammer up and down again after catching.


If that player is a Lad, they must strike their starting nail.
If they are a Lord, they must strike one of the center nails.


If a Lad hammers their starting nail completely into the stump, they instantly ascend to the rank of Lord. 
This can happen between strikes.
I.e. if a Lad has two strikes because he or she performed a double hammer flip, and they drive their starting nail completely into the stump on the first hit, the next hit must be performed on a center nail as Lord.


A nail is considered completely hammered into the stump if all plays agree or if the Hammer Test decides it is (see Hammer Test). Any player may challenge a nail and perform a Hammer Test. This effectively pauses the game. Giving away the hammer for someone to perform the Hammer Test does not end your turn, and that player must return the hammer to you upon completing the Hammer Test, resuming the game.


Each successful strike on a nail grants the player one drink to give out during the Drink phase. 
Each miss is one drink the player must take themselves during the Drink phase.


If a player hits the wrong nail it counts as a miss. If doing so results in the final center nail being hammered into the stump, A new center nail is created and the current player is removed from the game.


#### Drink
A "Drink" is a consistent unit which must be decided upon before the game begins.


During the drink phase the player may give out drinks for each successful strike they made during the Strike phase. 
For each strike made as a Lad, that player may give a drink out to another Lad. For each strike made as a Lord, that player may give a drink out to another Lord or make all remaining Lads drink at once.


The final strike of a starting nail is considered a strike made as a Lord, as that player becomes a Lord simultaneously to striking the nail.


The final strike of the game (the last center nail) is considered a strike made as a rank even higher than Lord. In this case all other players must drink.


The player then must drink for each missed strike he or she performed during the Strike phase.


Drinks may only be given out as long as the current player holds the hammer. If the player gives away the hammer without giving out drinks, their turn ends immediately and they forfeit giving out those drinks. However, they still must drink for each missed strike they made. Giving away the hammer for a hammer test does not count as forfeiting the hammer, and the player performing the hammer test must return the hammer when they are finished.


At the end of the Drink phase, the game ends and the current player wins if all 3 center nails are hammered completely into the stump. Otherwise the player passes the hammer to the next player in turn order and they begin their turn on the Flip phase.


### Hammer Test


A Hammer Test can be performed by any player to determine if a nail has been completely hammered into the stump. For a nail that has been hit in vertically, the hammer is turned sideways the head is run over the nail from all angles. The nail is considered completely hammered in if the hammer does not clink with the nail. For a nail hit in sideways the same rule applies except the hammer is run over the nail both ways lengthwise. If everyone agrees a nail is completely hammered in then the Hammer Test can be skipped. Any player may challenge another player's nail during their turn via the Hammer Test.


If the Hammer Test is performed during another players turn and that player gives up the hammer, it does not count as forfeiting the hammer; The hammer must be returned to that player after the test is complete.


### Demotions


If a Lord drops their hammer during the Flip phase they are instantly demoted to Lad. Before ending their turn they must drive in a new starting nail to the center position.
