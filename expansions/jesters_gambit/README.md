No additional materials required

## Additional Rules

During the Flip phase before flipping the hammer, if the active player is a Lad, they may call "Jester" before flipping the hammer.

If they call "Jester", the Lad becomes a Jester for the remainder of their turn. The Jester must perform a trick with the hammer that is incorporated into their Flip phase (e.g.: flipping the hammer behind their back, or under their leg, etc.). The Jester must describe the trick they plan to perform. If this trick does not sound adequately exciting as outlined, the other players may vote by majority to boo the Jester. The Jester must take one (1) drink and has the opportunity to present another trick idea or to end their turn. This process continues until either their turn ends or the players agree that a trick sounds entertaining. The Jester then proceeds to make their flip.

If the Jester successfully completes their trick as described and catches the hammer they are granted one (1) additional strike during the Strike phase of their current turn, and they are allowed to give their drinks to a Lord during the Drink phase of their current turn.

If the Jester fails to complete their trick and/or fails to catch the hammer, they must drink twice and they lose their next turn.
